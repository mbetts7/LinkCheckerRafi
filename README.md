# LinkChecker

This is a demo application.  The basic functionality is a site that allows the user to enter a url.  The LinkChecker will then parse the contents of the url entered using nokogiri, get all the link tags in the page, and check if the links are valid (returns a 200 or 300).

## Objectives

* Show a use case for doing work in the background
* Demonstrate Redis and Sidekiq to fix the problem
